# RecruitmentTask
There are employeeâ€™s personal data in data.json file. The task is to:
- present them in a table and to implement filtering according to each attribute 
(it is recommended to use any datepicker for attribute date type),
- do sorting and pagination (5 results for one page),
It is allowed to use any library, but every functionality (filtering, sorting, pagination) should be
implemented independently.
